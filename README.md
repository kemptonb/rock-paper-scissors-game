# rock-paper-scissors-game

RPS game using JavaScript.

I practiced:

    --Functions: multiple parameters, global variables, and local variables.

    --Conditional logic: if and switch statements.

    --DOM manipulation: made JavaScript variables and calculations visible in HTML.

    --Git: programming saved on GitHub using push/pull, clone, checkout, branch creation, and merge. 

    --Simple UI: basic HTML and CSS.
